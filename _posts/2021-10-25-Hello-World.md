## This is my first post using jekyll and github pages
This blog was pretty simple to set up. I forked the jekyll repo and then changed some config files to reflect personalizations. I hope you like it!

## Next Steps
Next I need to update the about page and links. I also need to change the styling, as I don't want to seem lazy about that.
