## This is my first blog post using Jekyll and Github Pages
### Set up was so easy
This was incredibly simple to set up. I didn't have to fiddle with any ruby dependencies and the web page is hosted for free by github.
### Posting is done with github commits
The CMS is managed with prose.io in markdown language. I can quickly create content, commit changes to github and seet results in 30 seconds.
